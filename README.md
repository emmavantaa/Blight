# Blight
2D shooter <br>
It was originally suppose to become a doughnut collecting game but ended up making it a post-apocalyptic game.

I worked on this project alone and it was one of my first bigger project I worked on when I started to focus on coding. I learned a lot along the way and got a better understanding on how scripts work.
